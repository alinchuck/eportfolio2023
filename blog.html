<h1>Why I am here</h1>

<h2>By: Alexa Linchuck</h2>

<p>As I walked through those two red metal doors and saw the lights shining bright on the court, I knew as a young girl that my passion would drive to be in sports. I grew up in a household where my mother was a cheerleader and my father was a soccer player. I know you would think that my parents would have two athletic children but in my brothers eyes he wanted to be able to code. I, on the other hand, started my athletic life at a young age. I remember my first time playing soccer in kindergarten with some of my friends. My mother had tried to put me into a ballet class but I would just cry and scream until my mother picked me up and told the instructor it was my first and last day there. I did indeed try hip hop in elementary school, but once again that was just not for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Entering elementary school I was a very troubled kid. I would get sent to the principles office for fighting with the boys in my class and at recess. I wanted to always play the games they were playing, which were; basketball, soccer, kickball, dodgeball, and tag. While the girls made fun of me for wanting to play these games instead of Chinese jumprope and swing on the monkey bars my mind was set on beating the boys at there own game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being chosen last for everything did not stop me from loving the game. I remember I used to wear these long under armor shorts that would hang below my knees. A bright orange under armor sweatshirt that would be sizes way to large for my body. Knee high socks and basketball shoes every single day. Having this type of style would cause for a lot of attention to be on me. Especially by my &quot;friends&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My main sport that I had chosen at recess was basketball. I loved the way the game was played and the aggressiveness of the players. Although I also played flag football, soccer, and tennis, basketball had stuck with my till high school. By fourth grade I had been onto my second soccer team where it was considered a traveling league. My family and I would take road trips to Richmond, Virginia, and places in PA and around MD to play other teams. This lasted till I was in 7th grade.</p>

<p>While in 7th grade I was able to finally try out for my middle schools soccer and basketball team. Unfortunately I did not make the soccer team but I really could&apos;ve cared less since I had quit the sport. But let me tell you, it was not easy quitting soccer. I had love the atmosphere and my team. It was all because of my AAU basketball coach who told me to choose one sport to play. I now look back and wish I never listened to him.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 16px;">For the middle school basketball team I had barely made the cut. The coach had taken me and one other girl out in the hallway to tell us we would not be playing as much because of our height. Seriously, our height? I was so frustrated and confused when she had told me this because I had experience in basketball and never thought about my height being an issue. I was a benchwarmer each and every game and I hated it. My AAU coach had actually come to a game to watch me play and was appalled to see that I never stepped foot onto the court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that game I had quit the team for middle school. I did eventually play softball my 8th grade year where I loved the coach and the team. I had never played the sport but I knew the rules of the game. I had an amazing arm, where I was then being played as an outfielder. We went undefeated and I had never felt a sport feel as fun to play and to watch before.</p>

<p>Freshman year of high school came and I was not really as nervous because I had been playing for the coach of the girls JV basketball team. Before winter sports came, I had played Varsity tennis as my fall sport. I loved the movement of the game and how I could be outside getting a tan as well. Winter sports came along and I had made the team freshman year as a starter with sophomores, making the most baskets. I then played JV softball in the spring with the same coach as basketball. Sophomore year arose and my coach had been promoted to the Varsity head coach of basketball. I had stayed on JV for about two games into the season when the Varsity coach, Bishop, pulled me aside and told me he wanted me to move up to play for him. I was so excited because I could finally say I was a Varsity basketball player for my high school and have that dream of running through those two red doors and having all eyes on me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first Varsity game was against our rivals who were terrible at the sport. He had started me with a very low qualified group of girls that did not really know how to play basketball well. I would get very stressed and start yelling for help but my teammates did not connect. After the look from that game my coach had benched me the rest of the year which caused me to become aggravated and want to quit. I had been waiting my entire life to play on the court and he was just taking it away from me. I really do not want to get too deep into my high school basketball career since it ended my senior year due to Covid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my earliest jobs had been helping Bishop coach his younger girls. I had helped coach his younger girls team to there first win. I also helped with the score board and the stats. Having the ability to still help out with the sport had made me realize I wanted to take this further into my career. I also had a job as a &quot;coach&quot; for this summer program where I had taught kids how to play basketball. I would film the game and then rewatch it and tell them what to improve on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at schools Tampa was not even an option my college counselor had given me. The only thing I knew about Tampa was that it was in Florida and my dad had gone there. Yes, we would take trips to visit the school with my family when we were younger but I would always joke around saying I would never end up there. But once I visited the school in person I knew I wanted to be in Florida and at Tampa. The opportunities felt endless and I was excited to major in sports management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My freshman year I did not have a job but declared a minor in communications. Sophomore year I moved off campus and got a job at the JCC gym where I had the worst encounters and bosses/leaders. Once again I won&apos;t get into detail but I should&apos;ve sued when I had the chance. The head of the department for Sports management would send out emails with volunteer opportunities and jobs were available. The one that caught my eye was working in the game day booth at the Steinbrenner Field for the New York Yankees Spring Training season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had gotten hired right away. I became close with all the workers and loved what I was doing. What was I doing you might ask. Well at first I started working on analytics and stats which was really hard not knowing how the software had worked. I then moved over to the scoreboard where I could sit and watch the game with also keeping track of the balls, strikes, walks, and the score.</p>

<p>Once spring season was over we all transitioned into the Tampa Tarpons which are the New York Yankees minor league. I was then able to work on the camera. Above high home and wireless. I learned how to use the graphic board where you see everything on the main field and show the graphics. And my favorite part of the job was when I get to direct and use the tricaster. I love being in control and a leader because growing up I never had a good leader in my life. I would make sure to communicate with the team, use the walkies, get feedback, count downs, telling when a camera was live and not live, telling the sports graphics when to go live as well and to take it off. I was the one switching the camera angles and taking control of what the audience had seen.</p>

<p>I felt at home. I finally had found a job and an environment I love where I can still watch sports. My coworkers and I over the summer would travel around Florida to watch the Tarpons play. We would talk with the players and eat food all together. The season came to an end at the end of August but I am so excited for Spring Training in February. I have a busy schedule next semester because I also got an internship with a Catholic High School where they focus mainly on sports. I will be able to help the athletic director and the social media. I want to stay in the sports area as long as I can where I am able to watch the game and get some hands on learning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My name is Alexa Linchuck and I have had a passion for sports since I was born.</p>
